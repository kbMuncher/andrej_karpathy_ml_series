# 🚀 Hands-On Machine Learning with Andrej Karpathy's Video Series

Welcome to my journey of implementing machine learning concepts from scratch, inspired by **Andrej Karpathy's** incredible video series! This repository is a collection of hands-on implementations, experiments, and notes as I dive deep into the fundamentals of machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning.

## 📜 About This Repository

This repo is my personal playground for understanding the core concepts of machine learning by building everything from scratch. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's teaching style, I aim to demystify the "magic" behind ML by breaking down complex ideas into simple, intuitive, and practical implementations.

Each implementation is heavily commented, beginner-friendly, and designed to help you (and me!) truly understand how things work under the hood.

## 🛠️ Implementations

Here’s what I’ve implemented so far:

### 1. **Micrograd: A Tiny Autograd Engine**
   - A minimal implementation of automatic differentiation (autograd) inspired by PyTorch.
   - Includes support for scalar values, backpropagation, and gradient computation.
  

### 2. **Building a Neural Network from Scratch**
   - A simple feedforward neural network implemented using Micrograd.
   - Includes training loops, loss functions, and basic optimizers.
